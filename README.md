# Data-Cleaning-with-Pandas

## Overview:
<p>This project focuses on the cleaning and preprocessing of a customer call list dataset. The objective is to prepare the data for analysis by resolving issues such as missing values, inconsistent data entries. The cleaned dataset is intended for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) and insights generation.</p>

## Dataset Description:
<p>The original dataset contains information related to customer calls, featuring variables such as:</p>
<p>CustomerID, First_Name, Last_Name, Phone_Number, Address, Paying Customer, Do_Not_Contact, Not_Useful_Column</p>

## Tools and Technologies:
<p><strong>Python:</strong> Primary programming language used for data manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>Pandas:</strong> Library utilized for data cleaning and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Environment for running and documenting the data cleaning process.</p>

## Steps Taken:
<p><strong>Data Import:</strong> Loaded the customer call list dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.</p>
<p><strong>Data Inspection:</strong> Analyzed the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.</p>

## Data Cleaning:
<p>Removed duplicate entries.</p>
<p>Addressed missing values by either imputing or omitting records.</p>
<p>Standardized date formats and categorical values.</p>

## Prerequisites:
<p>Python installed on your machine.</p>
<p><strong>Required libraries:</strong> Pandas</p>

## Conclusion:
<p>This project showcases my ability to clean and preprocess datasets using Pandas. The refined dataset is now ready for analysis, enabling insights into customer interactions and call trends.</p>
